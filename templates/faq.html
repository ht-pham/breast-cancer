                <h3>What is this application for?</h3>
                <p>This application uses machine learning models to analyze mammogram data and assist in predicting the likelihood of breast cancer.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How accurate is the prediction?</h3>
                <p>The app uses advanced machine learning algorithms, including KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks, achieving an accuracy of 90% in evaluations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What kind of data does the app require?</h3>
                <p>The app requires numerical inputs for 10 features derived from mammogram scans. These inputs are essential for accurate predictions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Which machine learning models does this app use?</h3>
                <p>The app uses four models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Neural Networks. Results from all models are displayed for comparison.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can this app replace a medical diagnosis?</h3>
                <p>No, this app is a tool designed to assist healthcare professionals and researchers. It should not be used as a substitute for a professional medical diagnosis.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Who can use this app?</h3>
                <p>This app is designed for educational and research purposes. Healthcare professionals may find it useful for initial analysis, but it is not a diagnostic tool.</p>
